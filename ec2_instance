1. What does AWS EC2’s EBS mean?

Ans:

For use with Amazon EC2 instances, persistent block storage volumes are offered via Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). Any operating instance inside the same availability zone can be connected to EBS, which has dependable and highly available storage volumes. They are automatically replicated inside their Availability Zone to shield them from component failure. Data persistence beyond the lifecycle of a single EC2 instance is made possible by the feature that allows EBS volumes to be stopped and resumed without causing data loss.

2. How are EC2 instances monitored?

Ans:

Amazon CloudWatch, a service that offers real-time monitoring of AWS resources and applications, can be used to monitor EC2 instances successfully. It gathers and tracks data, gathers and keeps an eye on log files, creates alarms, and responds automatically to modifications made to AWS services. Metrics, including network traffic, disk read/write activity, and CPU utilization, can be tracked by CloudWatch for EC2 instances. Enabling comprehensive monitoring on EC2 instances makes data available in 1-minute intervals instead of the typical 5-minute interval, which is helpful for in-depth insights.

3. Explain Elastic IP (EIP) in AWS EC2.

Ans:

An Elastic IP address (EIP) is a static IPv4 address offered by AWS for dynamic cloud computing. EIPs can be associated with any running instance in a region and mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in account. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, EIPs allow to mask instance or application failures by programmatically redirecting network traffic to another instance. An EIP is free when associated with a running instance but incurs charges when disassociated, encouraging efficient use of resources.

4. What is the difference between Elastic IP and Public IP in AWS EC2?

Ans:

Feature	Elastic IP	Public IP
Type	
Static IPv4 address

Dynamic IPv4 address (by default)
Persistence	Persistent until explicitly released	Dynamic, changes upon instance stop/start
Association	
Can be associated/dissociated at any time

Automatically assigned at launch, released at termination
Control	Can be allocated to and retained by AWS account	Assigned from a pool of available addresses, not reserved
Use Case	
Suitable for scenarios requiring a fixed IP address

Suitable for temporary instances or applications with dynamic IP needs
5. What is EC2?

Ans:

A web service called Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offers scalable computing capability in the cloud. Its purpose is to simplify web-scale cloud computing for developers. The straightforward web service interface of EC2 makes it easy to obtain and configure capacity. Can operate on Amazon’s reliable computing environment and control computer resources. By cutting the time it takes to procure and boot new server instances to minutes, EC2 enables to scale capacity up and down quickly in response to changes in computing needs.

6. What are Spot Instances, and how do they differ from On-Demand Instances?

Ans:

The pricing for Spot Instances fluctuates based on supply and demand for EC2 capacity.
Unlike On-Demand Instances, which provide fixed rates and guaranteed availability, Spot Instances can be interrupted by AWS with two minutes of notification when AWS needs the capacity back.
Spot Instances is ideal for flexible, interruption-tolerant tasks such as batch processing, data analysis, or background tasks.
7.  Explain what an EC2 Dedicated Host is.

Ans:

Dedicated Hosts allow to use existing server-bound software licenses, like Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (subject to license terms), and can help meet compliance requirements. Unlike standard EC2 instances that share the host machine with other customers, Dedicated Hosts ensure that instances run on isolated hardware. They provide visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server, which can be essential for optimizing license costs, regulatory requirements, or performance.

8. Describe the lifecycle of an EC2 instance.

Ans:

The lifecycle of an EC2 instance begins when it is launched and ends when it is terminated. After launching, an instance goes through the pending state as it is prepared for use. Once ready, it enters the running state, where it is operational and can be accessed. Instances can be stopped and restarted, moving between the stopped and running states without data loss on EBS volumes. Modifications, such as changing the instance type, can be performed while it is stopped. Finally, terminating an instance permanently removes it and typically deletes any attached EBS volumes unless configured otherwise.


Life cycle of EC2 instance
9. How can improve the security of EC2 instances?

Ans:

Improving the security of EC2 instances involves several practices. 
Firstly, Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) should be used effectively to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance and subnet levels, respectively.
Secondly, ensure only necessary ports are open and use SSH keys for Linux instances or RDP for Windows instances for secure access. 
Implement IAM roles for EC2 instances to securely access AWS services without storing credentials on the Instance. 
Regularly patch and update the operating system and applications.
10. What is an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and how does it work with EC2?

Ans:

An Elastic Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets in numerous Availability Zones, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. This improves the fault tolerance of the applications. ELB detects unhealthy instances and reroutes traffic to healthy instances until the unhealthy instances have been restored. It offers three types of load balancers that all feature high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make applications fault-tolerant. ELB integrates seamlessly with Amazon EC2, providing a fully managed load-balancing service.

14. Explain Auto Scaling and how it benefits EC2 workloads.

Ans:

Auto Scaling ensures that the correct number of EC2 instances are available to handle the load for the application. It automatically adjusts the amount of computational resources based on the volume of user traffic or other specified conditions. This not only improves application availability and fault tolerance but also helps minimize costs by adding resources only when needed and terminating them when they’re not. Auto Scaling can be configured to maintain the health and performance of all instances in the group by performing health checks and replacing instances that are terminated or otherwise become unhealthy.

15. What are the benefits of using Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances?

Ans:

Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RIs) provide a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand instance pricing in exchange for a commitment to use the Instance for a one or three-year term.
RIs can provide a capacity reservation, offering peace of mind that can access EC2 compute capacity when needed. 
They are best suited for applications with steady state or predictable usage and can lead to substantial cost savings over time.
RIs can be purchased in three payment options – All upfront, Partial upfront, and No upfront – to meet various budgetary needs.
16. Describe the process for transferring an EC2 instance to a different region.

Ans:

Transferring an EC2 instance to a different region involves several steps. First, create an AMI for the example in the current region. This AMI is a snapshot of the Instance, including its configurations and data. Then, copy the AMI to the target region using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API. Once the AMI is available in the target region, launch a new instance from this AMI in the desired region. Finally, if applicable, update any relevant configurations such as security groups, network settings, and Elastic IPs to reflect the change in region.

17. How is data at rest secured on EC2 instances?

Ans:

Securing data at rest on EC2 instances involves encrypting the data stored on EBS volumes. AWS provides EBS encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys. When EBS encryption is enabled for a volume, data stored at rest, disk I/O, and snapshots created from the volume are encrypted. This process is seamless, with encryption and decryption handled transparently. Additionally, using IAM policies to control access to EC2 instances and EBS volumes enhances security.

18. What mechanisms can achieve high availability and fault tolerance with EC2 instances?

Ans:

Achieving high availability and fault tolerance with EC2 instances involves:

Deploying instances across multiple Availability Zones within a region.
Using Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming traffic across these instances.
Implementing Auto Scaling to adjust the number of cases dynamically based on demand.
 Amazon Route 53 routes users to the best-performing or closest region. Regular EBS snapshots and AMI backups are crucial for recovery, ensuring application accessibility and performance even during instance failures.

19. What is AWS Lambda, and how does it compare to EC2?

Ans:

The serverless compute solution offered by AWS Lambda automatically manages the underlying compute resources and executes code in response to events. Lambda is ideal for applications or back-end services that don’t need a persistent server.EC2, on the other hand, provides flexible, scalable virtual servers (instances) that allow to run applications with more control over the computing environment. Lambda charges are based on the number of requests for functions and the duration it takes for code to execute, whereas EC2 charges are based on the compute instance types and the duration the instances are running.

20. Explain Instance Store Volumes and how they differ from EBS Volumes.

Ans:

Instance Store Volumes provide temporary block-level storage for EC2 instances. Instance Store Volumes offer high I/O performance and are ideal for frequently changing temporary data, such as buffers, caches, or scratch data. However, if an instance is stopped or terminated, the data on Instance Store Volumes is lost. In contrast, EBS Volumes are persistent storage that can be attached to EC2 instances. EBS data is preserved on instance stop or termination and can be detached and reattached to another instance, providing more flexibility and durability.

21. What strategies can help reduce costs when using EC2 instances?

Ans:

To reduce EC2 instance costs, consider the following strategies: Utilize Reserved Instances for predictable workloads to take advantage of lower pricing. For flexible, interruptible tasks, leverage Spot Instances to benefit from reduced rates. Right-size instances based on performance data to avoid over-provisioning. Implement Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust instance count and size, paying only for what is needed. Additionally, shut down or terminate unused instances to prevent unnecessary charges.

22. What are the key features of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?

Ans:

It supports dynamic and scheduled scaling, enabling to scale application up or down based on demand or a fixed schedule.
EC2 Auto Scaling can also be integrated with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic among instances within and across AZs, enhancing the fault tolerance of application.
 Additionally, it offers health check replacements for instances found to be unhealthy, ensuring that application is always running on healthy cases.
23.How would an on-premises application be migrated to AWS EC2?

Ans:

Migrating an on-premises application to AWS EC2 involves several steps. The first step is to assess the application to understand its architecture, dependencies, and requirements. Choose a migration strategy (rehosting, re-platforming, refactoring, etc.) based on the application’s needs and desired outcomes. Prepare the AWS environment, including VPC setup, security configurations (security groups, IAM roles), and selecting the appropriate EC2 instance type. Utilize AWS Migration Services like AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) or Server Migration Service (SMS) for data and server migration.

24. How is data integrity and security ensured during data transfer to EC2 instances?

Ans:

Ensuring data integrity and security during transfer to EC2 instances involves encrypting data in transit and at rest. 
Secure protocols like SSH (e.g., SCP or SFTP) or HTTPS protect data during transfer. AWS Key Management Service (KMS) can manage encryption keys to secure data at rest. 
Implement network security measures such as VPCs, security groups, and NACLs to control access to instances. 
Regular auditing and monitoring with tools like AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch help detect and respond to security threats.
25. What steps should be taken to troubleshoot a connectivity issue to an EC2 instance?

Ans:

To troubleshoot connectivity issues to an EC2 instance, follow these steps: First, check the security group rules to ensure they allow inbound traffic on the necessary ports from the correct IP address. Verify that the VPC and subnet network ACLs permit the required inbound and outbound traffic. Confirm the instance is running and review its system log for any errors during startup. Ensure the VPC route table correctly routes traffic to and from the internet for instances in a public subnet. Ensure a NAT gateway or instance is configured correctly for private subnets’ outbound internet access.

26. How are EC2 instances monitored, and what metrics are crucial?

Ans:

Monitoring EC2 instances uses Amazon CloudWatch, which offers visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health. 
Key metrics include CPU Utilization to check instance performance, Network In/Out for monitoring data traffic, Disk Read/Write Operations for I/O performance, and Status Check Failed (Instance and System) to identify underlying issues. 
Setting up CloudWatch alarms for these metrics helps proactively resolve issues and maintain instance health and performance.
27. What is Amazon EC2 Instance Connect, and how does it enhance security?

Ans:

Amazon EC2 Instance Connect provides a secure way to connect to EC2 instances using SSH directly from the AWS Management Console or command line. It enhances security by offering a simple and temporary SSH access method, where push SSH public key to the instance metadata, and the key is automatically deleted after a short period (default is 60 minutes). This approach eliminates the need to manage SSH keys for each user and Instance, reducing the risk associated with long-term key storage and potential unauthorized access. EC2 Instance Connect also logs every connection attempt, providing an audit trail.

28. Describe how Elastic Beanstalk can be used with EC2 instances.

Ans:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Services for deploying applications which automate the deployment, provisioning, scaling, and monitoring of applications in the cloud.
When using Elastic Beanstalk with EC2 instances, upload application code.
Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. This integration allows the developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure.
It supports platforms like Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.
29. Explain how Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are used with EC2.

Ans:

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are the templates for virtual servers (instances) in the Amazon EC2 environment. They contain all the information necessary to boot cases, including the operating system (OS), the application server, applications, and associated configuration settings. Users can launch instances using predefined AMIs provided by AWS, community AMIs, or create their own custom AMIs. This flexibility allows for easy scaling, as new cases can be quickly launched with identical configurations, ensuring consistency across environment. Custom AMIs are particularly useful for speeding up the deployment of software, patches, or applications tailored to specific requirements.

30. How does Amazon EC2 use virtualization technology, and what types are available?

Ans:

Amazon EC2 uses virtualization technology to run instances and virtual servers in the AWS cloud. AWS primarily uses two types of virtualization: Paravirtualization (PV) and Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM). PV guests are aware they’re virtualized and can run on host hardware that does not have virtualization support in the CPU. However, HVM guests run as though they are on bare-metal hardware and can take advantage of hardware extensions that provide fast virtualization. AWS introduced the Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and lightweight hypervisor, which further improves performance and security, allowing nearly all the compute and memory resources of the host hardware to be available to instances.

31. What strategies are used for disaster recovery of EC2 instances?

Ans:

Regular Backups: Use Amazon EBS snapshots and automate Amazon Machine Image (AMI) creation for quick recovery.
Backup Storage: Store backups in Amazon S3 and use Amazon Glacier for long-term archival.
High Availability: Deploy applications across multiple Availability Zones and regions if necessary.
Infrastructure as Code: Utilize AWS CloudFormation for rapid replication of the environment.
DNS Failover: Employ Amazon Route 53 for DNS failover to redirect traffic during outages.
Regular Testing: Continuously test the disaster recovery plan to ensure rapid recovery.
32. Explain Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) in the context of EC2.

Ans:

The virtual network interface that can connect to an instance in a VPC is called an Elastic Network Interface (ENI). ENIs allow to design a network architecture within the AWS cloud that resembles a traditional network might operate in data centre.
Key features include having a primary private IP, one or more secondary private IPs, public IPs, an Elastic IP address (EIP), a MAC address, and the ability to attach and detach ENIs from instances. This flexibility supports several use cases,
33. How do Security Groups in EC2 work, and how do they differ from Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)?

Ans:

Security Groups in EC2 function as a virtual firewall for instances to regulate incoming and outgoing traffic at the instance level. Each security group has rules that filter traffic based on protocol, port, and source/destination IP addresses. Unlike NACLs, which operate at the subnet level, security groups are stateful; this means that if an incoming request is allowed, the response is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules. NACLs, on the other hand, are stateless, requiring both inbound and outbound rules to be explicitly set. Security groups offer instance-level security, while NACLs provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level.

34. How can EC2 instances be automatically scaled based on demand?

Ans:

Automatic scaling of EC2 instances based on demand is achieved using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and AWS CloudWatch alarms. Define scaling policies in Auto Scaling to adjust instance numbers based on metrics like CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom metrics. Set up an Auto Scaling group with minimum, maximum, and desired instance counts. Create CloudWatch alarms to monitor chosen metrics. When a metric exceeds a threshold, an alarm triggers the Auto Scaling policy to adjust instance numbers, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

35. Describe the process and benefits of using Amazon EBS-optimized instances.

Ans:

Amazon EBS-optimized instances provide dedicated bandwidth to Amazon EBS volumes, ensuring that neither the Instance’s other traffic nor the network traffic of some other cases impacts the communication between the Instance and its attached EBS volumes. 
This optimization helps in achieving consistent performance for I/O-intensive applications. When launch an EBS-optimized instance, AWS provides a dedicated connection between the Instance and its EBS volumes, allowing for higher throughput and lower latency in EBS I/O operations.
This feature is particularly beneficial for applications requiring sustained I/O performance, such as databases or transaction-heavy applications, ensuring they perform efficiently and predictably.
36. How does Amazon EC2 support high availability and fault tolerance?

Ans:

Amazon EC2 supports high availability and fault tolerance through multiple mechanisms: Availability Zones (AZs), Elastic IP addresses (EIPs), Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and Auto Scaling. By deploying instances across multiple AZs within a region, can protect applications from the failure of a single data centre. EIPs can be quickly remapped from one Instance to another to handle instance failures. ELB distributes incoming traffic across instances in multiple AZs, increasing the fault tolerance of applications. Auto Scaling ensures that have the correct number of EC2 instances available to handle the load for application, automatically launching new instances in an AZ if there are failures.

37. What are Spot Instances, and how can they benefit cost-saving strategies?

Ans:

Spot Instances, instead of On-Demand pricing, can drastically reduce AWS computing costs by allowing bids on spare EC2 capacity and allowing such instances to operate as long as the bid exceeds the current Spot price.
Utilizing Spot Instances is ideal for workloads that are flexible in when and how long they run, such as batch processing jobs, development and test environments, or any application that can handle interruptions gracefully.
By incorporating Spot Instances into cost-saving strategy, can optimize AWS costs without sacrificing the performance or availability of applications, provided manage the interruption aspect effectively.
38. What is the Difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?

Ans:

When an EC2 instance is present, it performs a normal shutdown and transitions to a “stopped” state. 
Stopping an instance means the Instance is not running; however, it’s still reserved and can start again at any time.
Can’t be charged for usage while it’s stopped, but you will continue to be arrested for any EBS volume storage attached to the Instance. 
Terminating an EC2 instance, on the other hand, deletes it and any attached EBS volumes (unless the volume’s deleteOnTermination attribute is false). 
Once terminated, the Instance cannot be started again. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any necessary data is backed up before termination.
39. How can EC2 instances be ensured to comply with specific regulatory requirements?

Ans:

Use AWS services and features for compliance and security to ensure EC2 instances comply with regulatory requirements. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls access to EC2 instances, while AWS Key Management Service (KMS) manages encryption keys for data at rest. Amazon CloudWatch monitors and logs for operational compliance, and AWS Config enables assessment, auditing, and evaluation of AWS resource configurations.

40. What are the implications of changing an instance type, and how is it done?

Ans:

Changing an instance type (resizing) can adjust the compute, memory, and storage capacities to better meet the application’s demands, potentially improving performance or reducing costs. To change an instance type, the Instance must first be stopped.
After stopping, can change the instance type through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API by selecting a new type compatible with the current Instance’s configuration (e.g., virtualization type, network type).
Once changed, can start the Instance again. Before changing, it’s essential to consider factors such as the new Instance’s pricing, performance characteristics, and any potential compatibility issues with the application.

Additionally, using Amazon EC2 Savings Plans offers significant savings over On-Demand pricing in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one or 3-year term.

43. Describe Instance Metadata and its uses in AWS EC2.

Ans:

Data about an instance that can be used to configure or oversee the active Instance is known as instance metadata. It includes details such as the instance type, the IP address, the AMI used to launch the Instance, and more. This information can be accessed from within the Instance itself without using AWS credentials, making it highly useful for dynamic configuration of your instances without hard-coding values. For example, you can retrieve the Instance’s public IP address for your application configuration files or scripts. This data is beneficial for scripting and automation tasks in cloud-init scripts or when using AWS SDKs.

44. How is traffic distribution managed to EC2 instances in different regions?

Ans:

Amazon Route 53: Routes end-user requests based on geographic location, latency, and health. Performs health checks and directs traffic to various regions.
AWS Global Accelerator: Improves application performance by directing traffic to the nearest healthy instance across multiple regions.
Lower Latency and Faster Transfer Speeds: Both tools enhance user experience by reducing latency and improving transfer speeds.
45. What is Elastic Block Store (EBS), and how does it relate to EC2?

Ans:

Persistent block storage volumes are available from Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for usage with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volumes are network-attached and last for an example on their own. This implies that you can start a new instance and reconnect the volume because the data on EBS volumes is preserved even when an instance is shut down. EBS volumes can be used as primary storage for file systems, databases, or any other application that needs access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage and fine-grained updates. They also offer high availability and durability.

46. What is the Difference between standard and Convertible Reserved Instances?

Ans:

Standard Reserved Instances (RIs) provide a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand instance pricing in exchange for committing to a specific instance type and usage (either 1 or 3 years) in a particular Availability Zone. 
They are best suited for steady-state usage where the computing requirements are well-known and unlikely to change. Convertible Reserved Instances,on the other hand, offer a lower discount (up to 54%) but allow more flexibility. 
They can be exchanged during their term for other Convertible Reserved Instances of equal or more excellent value, allowing changes to the instance family, operating system, tenancy, or payment option.
This makes them suitable for users with changing requirements or those looking to leverage newer, more cost-effective instance types over time.
47. What are some everyday use cases for Amazon EC2 Spot Instances?

Ans:

When compared to On-Demand rates, Amazon EC2 Spot Instances offer substantial savings on underutilized EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Everyday use cases for Spot Instances include stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications such as big data analytics workloads, containerized applications, high-performance computing (HPC), web servers, and development and testing environments. Spot Instances are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted or have flexible start and end times because if AWS needs the capacity back, Spot Instances can be terminated with short notice.

48. How is SSH access to EC2 instances securely managed?

Ans:

Use Key Pairs: Utilize critical pairs for authentication instead of passwords, as keys are more secure and less prone to brute-force attacks.
Configure Security Groups: Restrict SSH access (port 22) to known IP addresses to minimize attack vectors.
IAM Roles: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to control instance launches with specific key pairs.
Rotate SSH Keys: Regularly manage and rotate SSH keys to maintain access control.
Use Bastion Hosts: Implement bastion hosts as a secure entry point, isolating instances from direct internet access.
49. What is the Amazon EC2 hibernation feature, and what are its benefits?

Ans:

Amazon EC2 hibernation allows you to pause and resume your instances later from the saved state, preserving the Instance’s RAM contents to the root EBS volume. This feature benefits long-running processes or applications that take a long time to initialize. By hibernating instead of stopping or terminating an instance, you can quickly resume work without reloading data into memory or restarting the application, saving time and computational resources. Hibernation also helps save costs for workloads that do not need to run 24/7 by avoiding charges for instances when they are paused.

50. What are Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Warm Pools, and how do they benefit application scaling?

Ans:

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Warm Pools enable you to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of your applications by reducing the time it takes to scale out EC2 instances. By maintaining a pool of pre-initialized cases in a “warmed-up” state, Warm Pools allow you to quickly increase capacity in response to demand spikes without waiting for new instances to launch and initialize.
This mainly benefits applications with significant startup times due to initial load, configuration, or complex initialization sequences. Warm Pools not only enhance the user experience by providing faster scaling response times but also help manage costs by allowing instances in the Warm Pool to be stopped (not terminated), thereby incurring lower costs than running cases. This feature is essential for balancing performance and cost efficiency in dynamic environments.
51. Explain the EC2 Fleet and how it optimizes the procurement of computing resources.

Ans:

Amazon EC2 Fleet simplifies the provisioning of EC2 resources by managing thousands of instances with a single API call. It allows specification of capacity needs, instance types, and pricing options across Spot, On-Demand, and Reserved Instances. EC2 Fleet automatically launches the optimal mix of instances based on these specifications, balancing cost and performance. The main advantage is its ability to aggregate capacity across various instance types and purchase options, ensuring cost efficiency while meeting capacity needs. This is particularly useful for batch processing, data analysis, and image rendering, where costs can be significantly reduced without sacrificing performance.

52. How does AWS EC2 handle instance metadata and user data, and their common uses?

Ans:

Instance metadata and user data pass information into your EC2 instances. AWS provides a unique URL that instances can access to retrieve metadata information, such as the instance ID, public IP, and security groups. User data is scripts or data supplied to the Instance upon Launch, which can be used to run scripts after the Instance starts up or to carry out automated configuration chores. Typical uses of user data include installing software, updating the AWS CLI, or configuring network settings. Both metadata and user data are accessible from within the Instance, providing a flexible and powerful way to automate and configure instances without manual intervention.

53. Discuss the implications of changing an EC2 instance type and how it can be done.

Ans:

Changing an EC2 instance type involves modifying the Instance to a different size or family to adjust to changing workload requirements, such as needing more CPU, memory, or network capacity. This process can help optimize costs, improve performance, or both.
To change an instance type, the instance type must be stopped, the instance type changed, and then the Instance restarted. It’s essential to consider compatibility (e.g., virtualization type and network adapter compatibility), as not all instance types are compatible with each workload or AMI. Additionally, understand the billing implications, especially if moving from a reserved instance or using Spot Instances.
Changing instance types provides flexibility in managing and optimizing AWS resources, allowing applications to scale or adapt to new requirements efficiently.
54. What strategies can be employed to reduce costs associated with EC2 instances?

Ans:

To reduce costs associated with EC2 instances, several strategies can be employed:

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances in multiple AZs, increasing the fault tolerance of your applications.
Auto Scaling: This feature automatically adjusts the number of instances in response to changing demand, ensuring the application can handle the load even if a few cases fail.
Amazon EBS Snapshots: By creating snapshots of your EBS volumes, you can quickly recover your data in another AZ or region in case of failure.
Amazon EC2 Instance Store Backup: Regularly backing up data to Amazon S3 or EBS for instances that use instance store volumes can protect against data loss.
56. What is the Difference between vertical and horizontal scaling in AWS EC2?

Ans:

Vertical scaling (scaling up/down) adjusts the size of an instance within the same or different instance family, modifying its compute, memory, and storage capacities to meet workload demands. This is done by stopping the instance, changing its type, and restarting it.

In contrast, horizontal scaling (scaling out/in) involves adding or removing instances to handle varying loads. Managed by AWS Auto Scaling, this approach dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on policies and conditions like CPU usage or network traffic. Horizontal scaling enhances availability and fault tolerance by distributing loads across multiple cases, while vertical scaling increases the power of a single example for workloads that are not easily distributed.

57. Discuss the significance of instance types in AWS EC2.

Ans:

AWS EC2 instance types categorize virtual servers by CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. Choosing the right instance type is key to optimizing performance and cost. AWS offers general-purpose instances for web servers, compute-optimized instances for intensive tasks, memory-optimized instances for databases, and storage-optimized instances for high I/O workloads. Understanding your application’s needs helps select the best instance type for efficient resource use and cost savings.

58. How does AWS EC2 integrate with other AWS services?

Ans:

59. Describe the process of launching an EC2 instance from an AMI.

Ans:

Launching an EC2 instance from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) involves several steps. First, choose an AMI that serves as the template for the Instance, containing the operating system and any pre-installed software. Next, select an instance type that matches your desired balance of computing, memory, and networking resources. Configure instance details like the network and subnet, and add storage if the default EBS volume size or type doesn’t meet your needs. Configure a security group to define the rules for inbound and outbound traffic to your Instance.

60. What is EC2 Instance?

Ans:

An EC2 Instance is the virtual server in Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. It’s essentially a virtual computer that can run applications, services, and processes like you would on a physical computer. Instances come in different types, offering various combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity to meet the needs of particular applications.

Lightsail provides a simplified interface for deploying applications, websites, or development environments on preconfigured instances with a set monthly price.
It comes with all the essentials for getting a project off the ground, including a low-cost, predictable virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP.
62. How is an auto-scaled application launched on EC2, and what steps ensure proper scaling?

Ans:

To launch an auto-scaled application on AWS EC2, you define a launch template or configuration specifying the EC2 instance type, AMI, and other configuration details such as key pairs, security groups, and attached block storage. 
Next, you create an Auto Scaling group that references this template and defines parameters such as the minimum and maximum number of instances, desired capacity, and availability zones for deployment. 
You then define scaling policies based on performance metrics such as CPU utilization or network traffic, which trigger scaling actions to adjust the capacity dynamically.
It’s crucial to monitor the application’s performance using AWS CloudWatch to tweak scaling policies and ensure they align with actual application needs and performance goals.
63. What are AWS Outposts?

Ans:

For a consistent hybrid experience, AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to almost any data centre, co-location space, or on-premises facility. It is intended for usage in scenarios where users wish to run workloads on AWS infrastructure but are compelled to maintain them on-site because of local data processing requirements or latency constraints. Outposts enable almost any data centre, co-location space, or on-premises facility to utilize native AWS services, infrastructure, and operational models.

64. What is configuration management, and why utilize it for cloud resource provisioning?

Ans:

Systems administration and online operations have traditionally used configuration management. However, its cultural appeal has been restricted. Since version control was not implemented in software development, most systems administrators manually set up servers.
Then, each server may vary significantly, as they typically do. However, troubleshooting is simple because you can log in to the box and perform direct operations. With configuration management, servers are managed like puppet strings using a powerful automation tool.
The fact that all configurations are versioned and monitored forces standardization, best practices, and reproducibility.
65. Describe the Amazon Web Services concept to replicate perimeter security.

Ans:

Amazon EC2 does not offer traditional perimeter security, which we are already accustomed to utilizing firewalls and other devices. AWS supports security groups. SSH access can create a jump box’s security group with only port 22 open. A database group and web server group are then formed from there. The jump box group’s port 22 is only allowed to reach the webserver group, but ports 80 and 443 are open to all users. Additionally, the database group permits port 22 from the jump box group and port 3306 from the webserver group. Any machine can access the database if added to the webserver group.

66. Describe setting up a scalable and secure web application architecture using EC2.

Ans:

Setting up a scalable and secure web application on EC2 involves leveraging several AWS services and best practices. Start by deploying your application across multiple EC2 instances in different Availability Zones within an Amazon VPC for high availability.
Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across these instances, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.
Implement Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic fluctuations, ensuring that you maintain performance while controlling costs.
67. How do we use AWS Systems Manager with EC2 for system operations and maintenance?

Ans:

AWS Systems Manager simplifies system operations and maintenance by providing tools for efficiently managing EC2 instances and other AWS resources. Allowing you to automate operational duties contributes to the upkeep of system security and compliance. You can organize your resources with Systems Manager to facilitate group management. Without logging into each EC2 instance individually, you can use Run Command to remotely carry out administrative activities at scale across all the cases. Patch Manager streamlines the process of applying security and non-security updates to the manager.

68. How is network traffic controlled for EC2 instances within a VPC?

Ans:

Network traffic for EC2 instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is managed using AWS features for security and efficiency. Security Groups function as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level by specifying allowed protocols, ports, and IP ranges. Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level, offering stateless filtering of traffic entering and leaving each subnet.

69. How is AWS Lambda leveraged with EC2 for event-driven scaling?

Ans:

Integrating AWS Lambda with EC2 enables sophisticated, event-driven scaling solutions that respond to application demands. CloudWatch Events or EventBridge can trigger Lambda functions based on criteria such as CPU utilization thresholds or network activity.
The Lambda function can then adjust EC2 instance capacity programmatically, either by interacting directly with the EC2 API to launch or terminate instances or by modifying Auto Scaling Group parameters to manage scaling logic.
70. Discuss strategies for encrypting data on EC2 instances and their benefits.

Ans:

Encrypting data on EC2 instances involves protecting data at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality and compliance with regulatory requirements. AWS provides EBS encryption for data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage keys. When you create an EBS volume, you can opt to encrypt it, and any data written to the volume will be automatically encrypted before being written to the disk. You can use tools like BitLocker (for Windows) or dm-crypt (for Linux) for the operating system and application-level encryption.

71. What are the best practices for securing EC2 instances?

Ans:

Securing EC2 instances involves a multi-layered approach encompassing AWS-provided capabilities and general security best practices.
Firstly, always use Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances, ensuring that only necessary ports and IP ranges are allowed.
Implement the principle of least privilege by using IAM roles for EC2, granting only the permissions necessary for the tasks the Instance needs to perform.
Utilize Amazon VPC to isolate your instances in a private network, and consider using Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) for an additional layer of security.
72. What is AWS S3?

Ans:

An object storage service called Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides performance, security, scalability, and data availability that are among the best in the business.Any file can be kept on the cloud object storage service Amazon S3.Thus, you may save and retrieve any information on the Amazon S3 cloud.

81. What are Key-Pairs in AWS?

Ans:

Key-Pairs, which comprise a public key and a private key, are a component of AWS’s security measures for EC2 instances. An EC2 instance can have a crucial pair specified when it is launched. While the private key stays with the user, the public key is kept on the Instance to enable safe SSH access. You decrypt the login credentials with the private key to establish a connection to your Instance. Amazon generates the critical pair without keeping the private key on file to guarantee that only the user who generated the key pair can start a secure SSH connection to the Instance.

84. What is the purpose of using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and what is it?

Ans:

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is ideal for connecting a data center to cloud resources. Each instance in the VPC is assigned a private IP address, which becomes accessible from the data center once connected. This setup allows cloud resources to be used as if they were part of the local network.

85. Describe the Draining of Connections

Ans:

With the help of an AWS tool called Connection Draining, we may fulfill pending requests on servers being updated or retired.We allow the Load Balancer to have an outgoing instance fulfil its current requests for a while before forwarding any new requests by turning on this Connection Draining. If Connection Draining is not enabled, a departing instance will go off instantly, and all pending requests will fail.

86. In AWS, what is Power User Access?

Ans:

An Administrator User is the same as the owner of AWS resources. In addition to creating, editing, deleting, and inspecting resources, the Administrator User can provide access to other AWS users. A Power User is given Administrator Access without the ability to manage users and permissions. Although they cannot grant other users permissions, Power User Access users can edit, delete, view, and add resources.

87. What components make up a template for AWS CloudFormation?

Ans:

Output values
Parameters for the template
Tables of data
Materials
Version of the file format
88. How can EC2 backup be automated with EBS?

Ans:

To list the Amazon EBS volumes that are locally associated with the Instance, retrieve the list of instances and establish a connection with AWS using the API.
List every volume’s snapshots and give each one a retention period. Make a snapshot of every disk later on.
If the snapshot is over the retention term, delete it.
89. What distinguishes Instance Store from EBS?

Ans:

EBS is a type of long-term storage that allows for future data restoration. Conversely, an instance store is a type of temporary storage that is physically affixed to a host computer. One Instance cannot be detached and attached to another using an instance store. Data in an instance store is lost if any instance is stopped or terminated, unlike with EBS.
